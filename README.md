# Vulnerability Assessment

## Objective

The objective of this project was to perform a comprehensive vulnerability assessment on a client's machine using industry-standard tools and methodologies. This involved setting up a vulnerable machine, deploying a scanning tool, conducting the scan, analyzing the results, and providing actionable remediation steps.

### Skills Learned

- Gained practical experience in identifying and assessing vulnerabilities in a simulated environment.
- Learned how to deploy and configure Nessus for vulnerability scanning.
- Enhanced skills in analyzing scan results to determine the severity and impact of vulnerabilities.
- Developed the ability to compile comprehensive reports with detailed remediation steps.

### Tools Used

- **Metasploitable2**: Utilized as the vulnerable client machine for the assessment.
- **Nessus**: Employed as the primary tool for scanning and identifying vulnerabilities.
- **VMware**: Used to create and manage virtual machines for both the client and scanning environment.
- **Kali Linux**: Deployed as the operating system for setting up the Nessus tool and conducting the assessment.

## Steps

**Step 1: Setup Metasploitable2**

Metasploitable 2 is a virtual machine made to have security weaknesses on purpose. Throughout the course of this project, Metasploitable2 will serve as the client machine for which we are to conduct the vulnerability assessment on.

To set up the client VM, we download the Metasploitable2 VM as seen in the screenshots below.

Once metasploitable has been downloaded and unzipped, we proceed to VM and open a new VM using the unzipped metasploitable file.

Having completed the steps above, now we have our client machine set up on VMware and we can log in using the credentials provided below:

"msfadmin" as both password & login

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f73bfe2d-be57-4026-b992-e4e24edc69f6)

Now, we have been able to log in to the client’s machine. We then run the following commands to gain a better understanding of the system:

#To see file avaiilable of the machine

ls

#To see network information on the system including client ip address & mac address

ip -a

**Step 2: Install Nessus on Linux**

We have been able to establish the client’s IP address, so we move over to Kali Linux and run the following commands:

#To gather specific informations on the client IP including open ports

nmap 192.168.194.134

#To check the client IP is currently active

ping 192.168.194.134

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fe3d602-6dd3-47ca-bc6d-f53133edb433)



Seeing that the client machine has been set up and the IP address established, we now proceed to set up Nessus on our Kali Linux machine.

Once Nessus is downloaded, we open the Kali terminal for the downloaded file folder to allow us to work directly within the file directory easily.

We run the following commands on the Kali terminal:

#To switch to the root user & full administrative privilege

sudo su 

#To install the downloaded Nessus file

dpkg -i

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e613d01a-a124-4b72-a5b8-361556ab051e)


From the image above, we can now start the Nessus service and then proceed to access the Nessus GUI via the provided link: https://kali:8834/

#To start the Nessus service

start nessusd.serivce

Now that we have been able to access the Nessus GUI, the images below show different steps taken in setting up Nessus to carry out vulnerability assessments on the client’s machine:

**Step 3: Perform Vulnerability Scan**

At this point, Nessus has been successfully set up and we can now proceed to carry out the vulnerability scan on the client machine. To execute this, the following steps are carried out:

a. Click on the “Create New Scan” function.

b. Though we are presented with various scan functions, we select the “Basic Network Scan” option as our focus for this project lies within that function.

**Step 4: Analysis and Reporting**

Of the total 229 results found from the scan, 12 had a critical severity indicating the most concerning vulnerabilities with the potential for causing the most damage to the client’s organization, 11 had a high severity, 39 were medium, 11 had a low severity, and 159 were simply for informational purposes and not posing direct threats.

When we select each result, we are able to see an explanation of each vulnerability as well as relevant CVE links for further research, its CVSS score, and necessary remediation steps needed to fix the vulnerabilities. This is extensively detailed in the report below.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35e8b44a-c85e-444a-9832-0aa4115ad070)


Based on the findings captured above, all major vulnerabilities to the client machine can be resolved by the following measures:

Re-generating all SSH, SSL, and OpenVPN key materials.

Disabling SSL 2.0 and 3.0, and utilizing TLS 1.2 (with approved cipher suites) or higher instead.

Enabling strong password policies.

Commenting out the ‘rsh’ line in /etc/inetd.conf and restarting the inetd process. Alternatively, disable this service and use SSH instead.

Applying the appropriate hotfix referenced in vendor advisories.

Performing system software upgrades and patches across all internal tools and vendors.

Enabling access restrictions or disabling directory indexing.

A comprehensive report with recommended actions for remediation is captured in the report below.

## Conclusion

This project successfully identified and documented critical, high, medium, and low-severity vulnerabilities within the client’s machine. Using Nessus and Metasploitable2, we were able to highlight significant security weaknesses and provide detailed remediation steps to mitigate these risks. By implementing the recommended actions, the client can enhance the security posture of their environment, reducing the potential for cyber threats and ensuring a more robust defense against future vulnerabilities. Continuous monitoring and periodic assessments are advised to maintain the system’s security integrity.
